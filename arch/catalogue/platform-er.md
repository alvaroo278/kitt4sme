KITT4SME Platform Exploitation
------------------------------
> ...still a work in progress!


### Description

The KITT4SME platform is a distributed software system designed to
deliver affordable, tailor-made AI at scale to European manufacturing
SMEs.

The platform features a 5-step workflow through which manufacturers
on a budget and no IT expertise can still benefit from AI. The workflow
begins with a "Diagnose" step where a company profile is elicited to
determine business needs and opportunities for improvement. Using this
information, in the "Compose" step, a company-specific, optimal subset
of services is selected from the service marketplace. This tailor-made
service kit is then assembled and deployed to acquire information from
the manufacturer's shop floor. The kit processes that information to
determine whether the shop floor is en route for a desirable or undesirable
outcome---e.g. detect and explain anomalies, visualise key performance
indicators, etc. These activities comprise the "Sense" step. In the
"Intervene" step, the kit suggests and negotiates corrective actions
to steer the shop floor towards the desired production and staff well-being
goals. Finally, in the "Evolve" step, the outcome is analysed to improve
the Diagnose and Compose steps, and to propose personalised staff training.

From a technical standpoint, the platform can be characterised as a
service mesh, multi-tenant, cloud architecture to assemble AI components
from a marketplace into a tailor-made service offering for a factory,
connect them to the shop floor, and enable them to store and exchange
data in an interoperable, secure, privacy-preserving and scalable way.

Both the platform provider and AI developers benefit from this cloud
architecture. Thanks to extensive pooling of computing resources and
sharing of services among tenants, the platform provider can dramatically
reduce operational costs which, in turn, results in lower service cost
for manufacturing SMEs. AI developers leverage the platform compute
infrastructure so they can focus on delivering business value rather
than building infrastructure.
